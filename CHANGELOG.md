## [Unreleased]

## [0.21.0]

The first public release. Penitent maps Oracle PL/SQL packages to Java interfaces, driven by the database dictionary:
see the [README](README.md) and the [documentation](docs/README.md).

### Fixed

- A `LocalDateTime` or `LocalDate` no longer depends on the JVM's time zone. In a zone with daylight saving time, a
  local time that the zone skips, such as 02:30 on the day the clocks jump, used to move an hour without any error,
  and a day without midnight was stored at 01:00.
- A `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` attribute of an OBJECT, read into a `ZonedDateTime`, keeps the region instead of only
  the offset.

### Changed

- Spring Boot 4.1.2 for the versions the library is built and tested with.
